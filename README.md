# Digit-Recognition

Here, all the different functions for the Convolutional Neural Networks have been implemented at first. Then, we look at their efficient implementations by using **Intel MKL**, **openBLAS**, **pthreads** etc. And then, we use these accelerated functions to make the different layers to form the final LeNet for the digit recognition
